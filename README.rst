Unsupervised Context-based Segmentation (UCS) algorithm for optical Remote Sensing imagery
=====================================

Image segmentation is a traditional operation in Remote Sensing and a fundamental problem in image processing. It has been widely used, especially with the consolidation of Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA). We propose a new unsupervised context-based segmentation algorithm, which uses some concepts of the Bayesian approach, to perform image partition. The method relies on three levels of information: (1) unsupervised pixel classification with FCM algorithm, with the number of groups obtained usingstraightforward approach using morphological operations; (2) the 8-connected neighbourhood of a pixel; and (3) provision of context information granted by a priori segmentation.
